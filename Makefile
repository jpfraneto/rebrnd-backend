# DATABASE_HOST=localhost
# DATABASE_PORT=3306
# DATABASE_NAME=brnd_db_new
# DATABASE_USER=root
# DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_password
#
# For the PRODUCTION database (where data will be migrated FROM - READ-ONLY):
# PROD_DATABASE_HOST=your_prod_host
# PROD_DATABASE_PORT=3306
# PROD_DATABASE_NAME=brnd_db_prod
# PROD_DATABASE_USER=readonly_user
# PROD_DATABASE_PASSWORD=readonly_password
#
# These should be added to your .env file.
